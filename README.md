# üîπ Types of LLM Tuning

## 1. **Prompt Engineering (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought)**

* **What it is:** Carefully designing input prompts without changing model weights.
* **When to use:**

  * You don‚Äôt have access to model weights.
  * You want quick task adaptation.
  * Early PoC / experimentation.
* **Purpose:** Coax the model into desired behavior.
* **Impact:** No extra compute or training; performance depends on cleverness of prompts.
* **Example:**

  * Zero-shot: *‚ÄúSummarize this legal document in 3 bullet points.‚Äù*
  * Few-shot: Provide 2‚Äì3 input-output examples in the prompt.
  * Chain-of-Thought: *‚ÄúLet‚Äôs reason step by step‚Ä¶‚Äù* to improve reasoning accuracy.

## 2. **Prompt Tuning / Prefix Tuning**

* **What it is:** Learn small trainable embeddings (‚Äúsoft prompts‚Äù) that are prepended to every input. Model weights stay frozen.
* **When to use:**

  * You want lightweight task/domain adaptation.
  * Limited GPU/compute budget.
* **Purpose:** Adapt model behavior without full fine-tuning.
* **Impact:** Small storage (\~MBs per task), multiple task adapters can be swapped in/out.
* **Example:** Training a soft prompt for *customer support tone* while keeping the base LLM unchanged.

---

## 3. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) & Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**

* **What it is:** Train only low-rank weight updates (LoRA) or small subsets of parameters instead of the whole model.
* **When to use:**

  * Medium budget, but still want efficiency.
  * You want **multiple domain-specific adapters** for one base model.
* **Purpose:** Efficient adaptation while retaining general knowledge.
* **Impact:** Storage-efficient (\~hundreds of MBs vs 10s of GBs), fast training, strong performance.
* **Example:** Train LoRA adapters for Finance, Healthcare, and Legal separately, and plug them into the same base LLM depending on task.

---

## 4. **Fine-Tuning (Full Model)**

* **What it is:** Update **all model weights** on task/domain data.
* **When to use:**

  * You have large, high-quality domain/task-specific data.
  * You need maximum control over model behavior.
  * Compute resources are not a constraint.
* **Purpose:** Deep specialization.
* **Impact:** Model ‚Äúforgets‚Äù less relevant knowledge and becomes highly aligned to domain. Expensive to retrain for new tasks.
* **Example:** Fine-tuning GPT-like model on **legal case law corpus** ‚Üí strong at legal Q\&A but weaker at general tasks.

---

## 5. **Instruction Tuning**

* **What it is:** Fine-tuning with curated instruction-response pairs (human-written or synthetic).
* **When to use:**

  * You want the LLM to **follow instructions better** across tasks.
  * Building a general-purpose assistant.
* **Purpose:** Teach LLM to generalize instructions ‚Üí improves usability.
* **Impact:** Much more reliable task following; better zero-shot generalization.
* **Example:** Google‚Äôs FLAN-T5, OpenAI‚Äôs InstructGPT.

---

## 6. **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)**

* **What it is:** Train a reward model from human preferences, then fine-tune the LLM using reinforcement learning (PPO, DPO, etc.).
* **When to use:**

  * Safety, alignment, reducing harmful/toxic outputs.
  * Preference alignment with end-users.
* **Purpose:** Make outputs more helpful, harmless, and honest.
* **Impact:** Improves trust, but requires costly human feedback collection.
* **Example:** OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT uses RLHF to align with user expectations.

---

## 7. **Domain Adaptation (Continued Pretraining / Domain Fine-tuning)**

* **What it is:** Keep pretraining the LLM on domain-specific unlabeled text before instruction-tuning or fine-tuning.
* **When to use:**

  * Lack of labeled data, but abundant **unlabeled domain corpus**.
  * Need the model to understand domain jargon.
* **Purpose:** Teach model vocabulary, structure, and context of domain language.
* **Impact:** Improves downstream fine-tuning results.
* **Example:** BioGPT, FinBERT ‚Üí pre-trained on biomedical and financial text.

---

## 8. **Knowledge Distillation**

* **What it is:** Train a smaller student model to mimic a larger teacher LLM.
* **When to use:**

  * Latency or inference cost is critical (mobile, edge).
  * You want a compressed version of an LLM.
* **Purpose:** Reduce size and compute needs while preserving accuracy.
* **Impact:** Student is much smaller but inherits knowledge.
* **Example:** DistilBERT ‚Üí compressed from BERT.

---

## 9. **Adapters / Modular Fine-Tuning**

* **What it is:** Insert trainable adapter layers inside frozen LLM layers.
* **When to use:**

  * You want modular adaptation (multi-domain, multi-task).
  * Efficiency and reusability are important.
* **Purpose:** Specialize without retraining base model.
* **Impact:** You can store many adapters cheaply.
* **Example:** Adapters for **sentiment analysis**, **NER**, **translation** plugged into one base model.
